  <h1>Welcome</h1>

  <p>Welcome to the University of Oxford's research facilities and equipment
     on-line searchable database which was developed with funding from
     <a href="http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/">EPSRC</a>. The purpose of this database
     is to provide information on research
     equipment over £25k and on the University’s Small Research Facilities
     (SRFs) and to promote and encourage the sharing of equipment across the
     University.</p>

  <p>You can search for a piece of equipment using only the free text search
     field below, do an <a href="{% url "search" %}">advanced search</a> where you can refine by general
     location for Oxford, and by Institution and/or browse by <a href="{% url "browse" %}">category</a>
     or <a href="{% url "facilities" %}">facility</a>.</p>

  <p>If you would like to add or amend an entry, please see the Contribute
     page. For all other queries please see the Contact page.</p>

  <p>The <a href="{% url "last-issued" %}">Departments page</a> provides
    information on the departments involved in the database and the update
    status of their equipment entries.</p>
