  <h1>About the database</h1>
 
  <p>The database was developed as part of the Research Equipment Use and
     Sharing Project whose primary aim was to:</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>encourage collaboration and shared use of research facilities and
        equipment within Oxford, and</li>
    <li>to help researchers when considering developing grant applications
        (including where the Research Councils require an assessment of
        existing assets).</li>
  </ol>
 
  <p>The database holds information on equipment over Â£25k and documents the
     department and location, whether a piece of equipment is shareable or not,
     the technical specification (including modifications and limitations),
     availability, access, restrictions and a website link where available. In
     addition each piece of equipment has been classified under a category and
     sub-category listing.</p>
 
  <p>More information about Research Facilities and Equipment can be found on
     the <a href="http://www.admin.ox.ac.uk/researchsupport/facilities/">Research
     Support Website</a>.</p>
